## Scala Practice
This repository is just a summary of notes and exercises
I've been doing to practice Scala. This primarily follows
the crash course by Rock the JVM.
## Exercises 
I along with many others find that the best way to learn 
is to apply the techniques you've learnt to various 
problems. In addition, to the notes I attempt a number of problems too.
The solutions are in their own exercises packages in the 
relevant topic packages. Here is the list thus far
- SumAllIntegers: Create a Scala function which takes an integer n as an argument. The function should return the sum of all integers from 0 to n inclusive. 
- ScalarProduct: Define a function that takes two vector objects and returns their scalar product. To compute the scalar product, for each element in the first vector, multiply by the element in the same position in the second vector and then sum to obtain the result.
- ReverseString: Write a program that takes a string and outputs the reverse such that it now reads backwards.
- IdentityMatrix: Write a function which creates an n x n identity matrix, taking n as an argument
- BinaryConverter: Write a function which converts a given binary number to the number it represents in decimal form (tricky! had to beseech Google for the binary number generator part)
